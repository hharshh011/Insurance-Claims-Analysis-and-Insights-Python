# Insurance Claims Analysis and Insights

1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**: Import and merge the `claims_data.csv` and `cust_data.csv` datasets, audit for data type mismatches, convert the `claim_amount` to numeric, handle missing values, and create necessary flags (e.g., for unreported police claims).

2. **Customer and Claim Data Refinement**: Ensure each customer has a unique ID by retaining only the most recent claim record and categorize customers based on age groups (Children, Youth, Adult, Senior).

3. **Descriptive Analysis**: Perform calculations such as average claim amounts by segment, total claims based on incident causes, and analyze claims for specific demographics (e.g., adults from TX, DE, AK for driver-related claims).

4. **Data Visualization**: Create pie charts, bar charts, and trend graphs to visualize aggregated claim amounts by gender and segment, fraudulent claims by age group, monthly claim trends, and comparisons between male and female driver-related claims.

5. **Hypothesis Testing & Business Insights**: Conduct statistical tests to analyze claim amounts by gender, age category, year-over-year trends, age groups and insurance claims, and the relationship between the number of claims and claim amounts, with business implications.
